      To initialize the PPGSO branch and eliminate Atom's fixation on the entire core demos treeUsing
      I did something like this

      In Atom
        new branch

      In commandline
        git init in this directory
        git remote add https://github.com/jonschull/Lyte

      In Atom
        Publish

      Apparently to update you need to
        stage
        then commit
        then Push

    installed Terminal (right click or see icon at bottom left)

  June 24
    installed pythonIDE
    pyInstall and lyte no longer choke on purePython files that import pythonize
    Changed Themes via settings

Other Notes:  Keep these true
  Folding Text Alt Cmd [ and ]; also ^K and ^L via keyboard maestro
  Current template is "working dual PPGSO.html"
