This is lyte alpha1, April 30, 2018

The new lyteBuild.py copies the essential source files into a new directory (currently hard-coded as ../6best/)

It then runs some of them to make pyj files needed by others.

Only the files that are copied need to be version-controlled.

Plus the lyte3 architecture folder.
