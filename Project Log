June 23 To initialize the PPGSO branch and eliminate Atom's fixation on the entire core demos treeUsing
I did something like this

In Atom
  new branch

In commandline
  git init in this directory
  git remote add https://github.com/jonschull/Lyte

In Atom
  Publish

Apparently to update you need to
  stage
  then commit
  then Push
